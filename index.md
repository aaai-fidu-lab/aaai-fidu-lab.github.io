A workshop co-located with [NeurIPS 2024](https://neurips.cc/)

*Date: December 14 or 15, 2024 [TBD]*

This workshop aims to address the critical gap in evaluating the broader impacts of generative AI systems by bringing together experts on evaluation science and practitioners who develop and analyze technical systems. We will share existing findings, develop future directions for effective community-driven evaluations, and create comprehensive frameworks for documenting and standardizing evaluation practices.

**Note: Speakers for this workshop will be announced soon. Stay tuned for updates!**
