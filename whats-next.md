## Broader Impact Coalition

We're excited to announce the formation of a Broader Impact Coalition! Our experience has shown that evaluations are more effective when developed through multi-stakeholder consensus.

### Social Impact Card Demo

We demonstrated a social impact card during the workshop and are actively seeking feedback. You can explore and interact with the demo on Hugging Face:

### Coalition Goals

The upcoming coalition will focus on several key initiatives:

- Opensourcing diverse evaluation types, with particular emphasis on underrepresented areas like audio and video evaluations
- Producing research outputs, including impact card infrastructure, academic papers, and other resources
- Organizing the next EvalEval event
